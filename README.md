House Price Prediction

Firstly I performed Exploratory Data Analysis,Feature Engineering,Feature Scaling And Feature Selection to get useful insights from the data.

Here I made the model to predict the price of houses.I applied various models and performed their hyperparameter tuning.

The following models I applied:

1)Linear Regression

2)Ridge Regression

3)Lasso Regression

4)SVM Regressor

5)Random Forest Regressor

6)k-Nearest Neighbour Regressor

I found out Lasso has performed best out of all with a cross validation score of 0.86076
